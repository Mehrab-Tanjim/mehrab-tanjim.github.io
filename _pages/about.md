Hi! I am Mehrab, a 4th year PhD Student in CS with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My advisor is [Professor Garrison W. Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/). Recently, I have been focusing on deep generative models, especially debiasing them in different tasks such as attributes to image generation, image-to-image translation tasks, etc. I have also worked on and have research interests in recommender systems and federated learning. To learn more about my projects, please feel free to take a look at my [projects](https://mehrab-tanjim.github.io/portfolio) and relevant [publications](https://mehrab-tanjim.github.io/publications)!

Before joining UCSD, I was a research assistant working with [Dr. Muhammad Abdullah Adnan](https://sites.google.com/site/abdullahadnan/) at my undergraduate university, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I received my bachelor's in CS. There I spent a wonderful time developing scalable machine learning algorithms (e.g. PCA) in the distributed environment (e.g Spark/Hadoop). After joining UCSD, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Science intern at Etsy (Summer 2019) and Adobe (Summer 2020 and 2021). I am grateful to Adobe for the generous gift funds to my advisor for supporting my research.
